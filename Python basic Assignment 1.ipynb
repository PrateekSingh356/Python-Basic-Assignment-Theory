    "2. What is the difference between string and variable?\n",
    "a)A string is a literal text string, i.e. 'Hello'. whereas A variable is something that stores data - it can store a string, int, float, class, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "b)All strings are variables, but not all variables are strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "c)Variables in programs are references to values that have types. String is simply one of the handful of types that Python uses along with various number types, collection types (list, string , tuple, dict, and set), objects and a few more.\n",
    "\n",
    "d)A variable can hold a string, but a string can't hold a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "e)A variable is basically the name of the location in the primary memory of your computer. This can be chosen by you. A variable can store everything from strings to numbers. whereas A string is the values inside the quotes assigned to a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "f)In python anything you assign to a variable using quotes (single or double) will be considered as a string. Thus, a string is one of several types of a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "a = \"10\" b = \"20\" print(a+b) #prints 1020\n",
    "\n",
    "a = 10 b = 20 print(a+b) #prints 30 So, in the above example, (a+b) returns 1020 in the first case (string concatenation of 10 and 20), whereas in the second case, it returns 30 since it interprets a and b as integers at run-time.\n",
    "\n",
    "g)The string is 'spam'; the variable is spam. Strings always start and end with quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe three different data types.\n",
    "a)List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members. ex:-mylist = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "b)Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members. ex:-tuple1 = (\"abc\", 34, True, 40, \"male\")\n",

    "c)Set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members. ex:-myset = {\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"}\n",
